# NEXUS NEBULA HAS BEEN RELEASED! 🥳 check github releases or https://mirror.nexuspenn.org/ if its not working. 
Please note that all of the source code is made with the assistance of claude AI that is checked by a human then pushed, I can edit code but I cannot write thousands of lines. I respect those who can do this. I can edit it and find errors I just cant write it.

NexaOS utilizes unmodified Debian packages. The source code for all packages is accessible at https://sources.debian.org/ or via the command `apt-get source <package-name>`.

NexaOS is incompatible with secure boot. If you have Windows BitLocker enabled but secure boot is disabled, you’ll be prompted to enter a recovery key. To fix this, turn on secure boot. 

The default user is “customuser” and the password is “password”.
